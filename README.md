# QuakeReport
This is an Android app I made to learn more on Android and how apps are made on the Android platform. In this app, I learned how to use an API to fetch earthquake data in JSON format and display it nicely on the app. I made this app with the help of an amazing Android course on Udacity.

## Info
This app informs users of the most recent earthquakes that have occurred around the globe. It also includes a settings page that allows the user to control how earthquakes are ordered and a cutoff that only displays earthquakes with magnitudes larger than the cutoff.

## Some nice images of the app
